# Hue Utilities

Couple simple hue utils based off node-hue-api package

**hue-connect.js**

Searches network for a hue bridge, creates an api object with that and your user credentials.

**lights.js**

Script for activating certain scenes by keyword via the command line


## Notes

Very simple at the moment. 

Requres a file: config/config.js -- this should export a config object like so: 
 
	module.exports = {
		username: <your_hue_username>
	}
